    <h3>Inverted Beauty | Glitch Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>In an Intro to Digital Media Art course, I was grouped with two other students and we were each responsible for interpreting a portion of the final image. I was responsible for the "head" which I made with images of Ballooney and the Arc Reactor via Adobe Photoshop. After the final image was created, I glitched it via Audacity and used the invert and echo effect, resulting in the middle section's colors being inverted and a "static" style for the background.</p>

  <h3>A Frame of Today | Composite Art | 2019</h3>
  <p>In an Intro to Digital Media Art course, I worked with a partner where we independently interpret a still life with modern day objects. I started with a painting of a still life with picture frames I found off Google Images. From there, I inserted objects and images prevalent to millennial culture such as the millennial pink wall and the classic Instagram hand holding pose image.</p>

    <h3>Incoming Creature | Sound Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>The concept began with finding a flashing light on a 3D printer. From there, I layered scenes I filmed around the SJSU Art Department and used audio from my sound art project and an old Highschool Japanese project. To make the picture more visually interesting, I used chromatic aberration and opacity changes. </p>

    <h3>The Light | Video Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>During my Digital Media Art class, I was assigned to record sound around the SJSU campus, resulting sounds from a water fountain, my keys, and the inside of a Starbucks on the SJSU campus. After gathering these sounds, I used Audacity to distort the sound of my keys into a squishing noise while looping my other sounds to one minute. The results of this projects was a sound of an incoming squishy creature.</p>

  <h3>Things We've Seen | Net Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>In a group with two other students, we made a website where we each create a page based on what we see. Seeing and perspective is very subjective, so for my page, I decided to focus on the social media aspect. Because I go on Instrgram quite often and have seen a plethora of profile pictures inlcuding my own, I decided to piece together all of my profile pictures I ever had on Instagram via Photoshop.</p>

  <h3>Calm the Vampire | Code Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>In this piece, the user first sees an image of an angry Chinese vampire in front of a creepy forest. But when the site is clicked, there is a yellow talisman on the vampire and the vampire calms down and the background changes to a bright forest. In Chinese culture, when a talisman is placed on the forehead of the vampire, it will calm down. Through this piece, I experimented with the “if, else statement,” the “mouseIsPressed” code, “function preload,” and cursor design.</p>

  <h3>One Year | Net Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>I wanted to create something personal and blog-like. Initially, I wanted to cover events and stories through high school, but because high school is very broad and most of my stories are from senior year of high school, I decided to make each letter of my name “Michelle” a link to align to a random event during my senior year. The colors of the website -white, purple, black and gray- are the colors of my highschool. In addition to color usage, the pictures used are blurred and tinted blue to resemble a dreamlike memory and to keep a cool color scheme.</p>

  <h3>A Tale of Two Signs | Digital Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>Zodiacs and horoscopes. Despite their different origins, they are both collections of symbols assigned according to a person's birth year, month, day etc. As an Asian American myself, I want to explore the interactions between these two different cultures through this series of drawings. The Chinese character in all three pieces is translates to "Quan" or my last name. Every one of these pieces are dedicated to my family members. </p>
