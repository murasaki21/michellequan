    <h3>Narwhals, Narwhals | Net Art | 2020</h3>
    <a href="https://murasaki21.github.io/Narwhals/"><img src="images/Narwhals_Thumb.png"</a>
    <p> This entire website started from a very catchy song named "Narwhals, Narwhals." As a person who also likes cute drawings of Narwhals and other sea creatures with personality, I thought it would be fun to create an ocean adventure where the viewer can see these cute creatures while learning more about ocean life. All of the images used are either GIFs or stickers from GIPHY.com</p>
