    <h3>Things We've Seen | Net Art | 2019</h3>

    <p>In a group with two other students, we made a website where we each create a page based on what we see. Seeing and perspective is very subjective, so for my page, I decided to focus on the social media aspect. Because I go on Instrgram quite often and have seen a plethora of profile pictures inlcuding my own, I decided to piece together all of my profile pictures I ever had on Instagram via Photoshop.</p>
