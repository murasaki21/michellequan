    <h3>Inverted Beauty | Glitch Art | 2019</h3>
        <p>In an Intro to Digital Media Art course, I was grouped with two other students and we were each responsible for interpreting a portion of the final image. I was responsible for the "head" which I made with images of Ballooney and the Arc Reactor via Adobe Photoshop. After the final image was created, I glitched it via Audacity and used the invert and echo effect, resulting in the middle section's colors being inverted and a "static" style for the background.</p>
