  <h3>Incoming Creature | Sound Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>The concept began with finding a flashing light on a 3D printer. From there, I layered scenes I filmed around the SJSU Art Department and used audio from my sound art project and an old Highschool Japanese project. To make the picture more visually interesting, I used chromatic aberration and opacity changes. </p>

  <h3>The Light | Video Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>During my Digital Media Art class, I was assigned to record sound around the SJSU campus, resulting sounds from a water fountain, my keys, and the inside of a Starbucks on the SJSU campus. After gathering these sounds, I used Audacity to distort the sound of my keys into a squishing noise while looping my other sounds to one minute. The results of this projects was a sound of an incoming squishy creature.</p>

  <h3>Things We've Seen | Net Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>In a group with two other students, we made a website where we each create a page based on what we see. Seeing and perspective is very subjective, so for my page, I decided to focus on the social media aspect. Because I go on Instrgram quite often and have seen a plethora of profile pictures inlcuding my own, I decided to piece together all of my profile pictures I ever had on Instagram via Photoshop.</p>

  <h3>Calm the Vampire | Code Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>In this piece, the user first sees an image of an angry Chinese vampire in front of a creepy forest. But when the site is clicked, there is a yellow talisman on the vampire and the vampire calms down and the background changes to a bright forest. In Chinese culture, when a talisman is placed on the forehead of the vampire, it will calm down. Through this piece, I experimented with the “if, else statement,” the “mouseIsPressed” code, “function preload,” and cursor design.</p>

  <h3>One Year | Net Art | 2019</h3>
    <p>I wanted to create something personal and blog-like. Initially, I wanted to cover events and stories through high school, but because high school is very broad and most of my stories are from senior year of high school, I decided to make each letter of my name “Michelle” a link to align to a random event during my senior year. The colors of the website -white, purple, black and gray- are the colors of my highschool. In addition to color usage, the pictures used are blurred and tinted blue to resemble a dreamlike memory and to keep a cool color scheme.</p>

  <h3>Doors to Success | Video Art | 2020</h3>
    <p>Opportunity. Chances. Success. Failure. Opening doors can lead us towards or away from these things. Doors serve as a gateway connecting the known to the unknown. More often than not, we would open doors where we know what will happen compared to the unknown. Similar to how the path to success is an unpredictable one. As an aspiring digital media artist, the future is unpredictable and can be scary. There will be doors that lead to success and doors that won't. Despite the fear and failure, we still seek to open doors in search of success and happiness.</p>

  <h3>Living Through Change | Augmented Reality | 2020 </h3>
    <p>Sofas. Chairs. TVs. Pictures. Laptops. Today, most living or family rooms consist of these items. Throughout time, while technology and design trends come and go, the purpose of a family room remains the same: to spend time together with family. Of all the rooms in a house, my memories of spending time with friends and family in this room differentiated a home from any other building. Over the years, the items in my parents’ living room have moved around and changed, but we all still spent time together through watching movies, playing games, etc.</p>

    <p>In an exhibition space, I would have a loveseat couch and stock family pictures in frames on the couch as a centerpiece in the room with pieces of “old” technology around the couch or the family aspect. Using Aero, when a mobile device points at an old piece of technology in the room, a new version of the item would be seen on the device. For example, when the mobile device points at a joystick in the room, a Nintendo Switch would cover the joystick, conveying that while entertainment and group activities have changed, the idea of being together is still there. Hence, everything in the room except the couch and the family pictures would be digitally manipulated in AR in order to convey my idea of home and family.</p>
