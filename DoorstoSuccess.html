    <p>Opportunity. Chances. Success. Failure. Opening doors can lead us towards or away from these things. Doors serve as a gateway connecting the known to the unknown. More often than not, we would open doors where we know what will happen compared to the unknown. Similar to how the path to success is an unpredictable one. As an aspiring digital media artist, the future is unpredictable and can be scary. There will be doors that lead to success and doors that won't. Despite the fear and failure, we still seek to open doors in search of success and happiness.</p>
