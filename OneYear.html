    <p>I wanted to create something personal and blog-like. Initially, I wanted to cover events and stories through high school, but because high school is very broad and most of my stories are from senior year of high school, I decided to make each letter of my name “Michelle” a link to align to a random event during my senior year. The colors of the website -white, purple, black and gray- are the colors of my highschool. In addition to color usage, the pictures used are blurred and tinted blue to resemble a dreamlike memory and to keep a cool color scheme.</p>
